# za_emotion_detection

## Introduction

This project aims to identify human emotions using cameras. This work done during deep learning internship at [ZummitAfrica](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zummit-africa/?originalSubdomain=ng). We made use of the [Ferplus](https://github.com/microsoft/FERPlus) dataset. Transfer learning with various neural network architectures were used for classification. They include, Vgg16,EfficientNet0 and MobileNetV2.
Reults are as shown below.
